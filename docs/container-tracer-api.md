# container-tracer REST API
![container-tracer-api](container-tracer-api.png)  
The REST API is the only way to interact with `container-tracer`. It is served by both `tracer-svc`
and `tracer-node` modules.  
## Version 1
### Get PODs
`GET /v1/pods` Get list of all PODs running on the node / cluster.
The format of one entry from the list is:

``` shell
...
"<pod name>": {
    "Containers": {
      "<container name>": {
        "Id": "<container id>",
        "Parent": [
          <PID of the parent process>
        ],
        "Pod": "<pod name>",
        "Tasks": [
          <PID of the container process>
        ]
      }
    }
  },
...
```


Example request `curl http://<node>:<port>/v1/pods --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request "GET" | jq`
for a list of all pods. The entry describing a jaeger operator pod looks like this:

``` shell
...
  "jaeger-operator-7b46f44865-jvgz8": {
    "Containers": {
      "jaeger-operator": {
        "Id": "jaeger-operator",
        "Parent": [
          7337
        ],
        "Pod": "jaeger-operator-7b46f44865-jvgz8",
        "Tasks": [
          1002496
        ]
      },
      "kube-rbac-proxy": {
        "Id": "kube-rbac-proxy",
        "Parent": [
          7337
        ],
        "Pod": "jaeger-operator-7b46f44865-jvgz8",
        "Tasks": [
          7438
        ]
      }
    }
  },
...
```

### Get Trace Hooks
`GET /v1/trace-hooks` Get a list of all trace-hooks, that can be attached to a container.
The format of one entry from the list is:

``` shell
...
{
  "<relative path of the directory, where the trace hook is located>": {
    "Tracers": {
      "<name of the trace hook>": {
        "Description": [
            "<multi line description of the trace hook>",
            "<usually the trace hook specific arguments>",
            "<are described here>"
        ],
        "Name": "<name of the trace hook>"
      }
    }
  }
},
...
```

Example request `curl http://<node>:<port>/v1/trace-hooks --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request "GET" | jq`
for a list of all trace hooks. The entry describing the `trace_syscalls` hook looks like this:

``` shell
...
{
  "trace-hooks/ftrace": {
    "Tracers": {
      "trace_syscalls": {
        "Description": [
          "Trace system calls, used by given container",
          "-s, --syscall [SYSCALL ...] : list of System call names to be traced, optional argument.",
          "If no system calls are specified, all available are traced.",
          "-t, --time TIME : Duration of the trace in milliseconds, optional argument"
        ],
        "Name": "trace_syscalls"
      }
    }
  }
},
...
```

### Trace sessions management
#### Get configured trace sessions
`GET /v1/trace-session/<id>` Get a description of a trace session with a specific **id**.
If **all** is passed as **id**, a list of all configured trace sessions is returned. The format of
a returned entry, describing one trace sessions, is:

```shell
...
{
  "<trace session id>": {
    "Containers": {
      "<pod id>": [
        "<container id in this pod>"
      ],
    },
    "Context": "<user specified description of the session>",
    "Error": <error returned by the trace hook when starting the session, or **null** if there is no error>,
    "Id": "<trace session id>",
    "Node": "<name of the node, where this session is configured>",
    "Output": <output returned by the trace hook when starting the session, or **null** if there is no output>,
    "Running": <running state of the session>,
    "TraceHook": "<name of the trace hook, attached to containers from this session>",
    "TraceParams": [<list of specific parameters, passed to the trace hook>]
  }
}
...
```

Example request `curl http://<node>:<port>/v1/trace-session/6903485068587058765 --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request "GET" | jq`
for the description of a trace session with id `6903485068587058765`:

```shell
...
{
  "6903485068587058765": {
    "Containers": {
      "jaeger-599bd8cddd-f6tcj": [
        "jaeger"
      ],
      "jaeger-agent-daemonset-4fpcc": [
        "jaeger-agent-daemonset"
      ],
      "jaeger-operator-7b46f44865-jvgz8": [
        "kube-rbac-proxy",
        "jaeger-operator"
      ]
    },
    "Context": "test",
    "Error": null,
    "Id": "6903485068587058765",
    "Node": "calisto.zico.biz",
    "Output": null,
    "Running": false,
    "TraceHook": "trace_syscalls",
    "TraceParams": []
  }
}
...
```

#### Create a new trace session
`POST /v1/trace-session` Create a new trace session. It requires that a mandatory json file with
a session description be passed as part of this request. The format of this file is:

``` shell
...
{
	"pod": "<name of the pod to be traced, wildcards are supported to specify more than one pod>",
	"container": "<name of the container from specified pods to be traced, wildcards are supported to specify more than one container>",
	"trace-hook": "<name of the trace hook, that will be attached to the traced containers>",
	"trace-arguments": "<specific trace hooks arguments, used in this trace session>",
	"trace-user-context": "<custom context, attached to all traces>"
}
...
```

If the request is successful, a description of the newly created trace session is returned.
The session is not started by default.  
Example request to trace all containers in all jaeger pods:  
`curl http://<node>:<port>/v1/trace-session --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request "POST" -d @session.json | jq`  
where the `session.json` file is:

``` shell
...
{
	"pod": "jaeger*",
	"container": "*",
	"trace-hook": "trace_syscalls",
	"trace-arguments": "",
	"trace-user-context": "test"
}
...
```

#### Change state of a trace session
`PUT /v1/trace-session/<id>` Set the running state of a trace session with the given **id**.
It requires a mandatory json file with the new session state. The format of this file is:

``` shell
...
{
	"Run": <session state>
}
...
```

If the request is successful, an empty json is returned.  
Example of a request to run a trace session with id **6903485068587058765**:  
`curl http://<node>:<port>/v1/trace-session/6903485068587058765 --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request "PUT" -d @run.json | jq`  
where the `run.json` file is:

``` shell
...
{
	"Run": true
}
...
```

#### Delete a trace session
`DELETE /v1/trace-session/<id>` Delete a trace session with given **id**. If **all** is passed as **id**,
all trace sessions will be deleted. If the session is running, it will be stopped before deletion.
If the request is successful, an empty json is returned.  
Example of a request to delete all trace sessions:  
`curl http://<node>:<port>/v1/trace-session/all --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request "DELETE" | jq`
